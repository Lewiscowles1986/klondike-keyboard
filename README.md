# Klondike Keyboard

A Keyboard-controlled Klondike game, built with AI


![Screen capture of the game board showing a classic Klondike or Solitaire game, with 7 columns of cards, ranging from one in the left-most to seven in the right-most, with all cards but the last in those 7 columns turned face-down so the card cannot be seen. At the top-right there is a 4 column foundation, sitting empty, and in the top-left is the waste pile, of cards face down, with no cards removed from the waste.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4380cbde-2250-4089-8c12-35331d40415e)

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. You must have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed. This was developed using NodeJS 20
2. You should have [Git](https://git-scm.org) installed.
3. Git clone using `git clone https://github.com/LewisCowles1986/klondike-keyboard.git`
4. Change directory into the cloned folder `cd klondike-keyboard`
5. Install the dependencies using `npm ci`


### run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Developing

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Known bugs / areas of iteration

This is not provided to "dunk on" AI, but it does represent areas I feel I would focus on for further development.

- [ ] 3-card play is totally untested and I believe relies on the mouse
- [ ] You can only move an entire column from tableau
- [ ] Random uses JavaScript Math.random which does not take a seed
- [ ] Heavily coupled to ReactJS, Next, browser... IDK this feels like it should be playable in a console
      - [ ] the game should not "need" a UI (helps testing)
      - [ ] the game should be able to put on a face-lift
- [ ] Non-semantic HTML elements used
- [ ] No test suite
- [ ] No scoring or time display
- [ ] No saved game or ability to come back and resume play
- [ ] I dont know that all generated games are complete-able
- [ ] I'm as-yet unsure about how to entice players to play more (borders on gambling) :laugh:
- [ ] I would like to de-couple controllers, and perhaps given a seed to predictably shuffle cards, like a command-pattern way to push actions to a stack, so the game can play-through
- [ ] There is no way to tell a player they've lost
- [ ] I'm pretty sure there is something messing with focus in this
- [ ] I'd like to play with Aural announcement to experiment with non-visual interface
- [ ] After completing the game, I was unable to use the N key, and had to hit the button for "New Game"
      - I did not tab to it. I used a cursor.

## Provenance

This project was originally AI generated by v0.dev

I'd heard a lot of hype around it, and rather than try to prove how stupid AI is, or how smart I am... I Instead tried to see if it could solve known problems.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). using Default instead of New York, because honestly I don't know what that meant.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Judgement (opinion)

Very impressed

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
